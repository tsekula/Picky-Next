![Picky Screenshot](https://github.com/tsekula/Picky-Next/blob/master/public/images/Picky%20Screenshot.jpg)
## üåü Project Overview

### ü§î What is Picky?
Picky is an online image gallery designed to manage and search through a user's extensive library of digital photos. The app's unique selling point is its ability to search and filter images based on natural language queries, including the names of people in the images. Picky delivers relevant images quickly and accurately by leveraging a combination of advanced concepts and AI tools, such as machine vision, vector or graph databases, and Large Language Models (LLMs). Each user has their own private account and gallery, ensuring a personalized and secure experience.
### üéØ Why was Picky built?
I wanted to give a talk to [my local AI meetup group](https://www.meetup.com/heidelberg-ai-community/) about using AI at every step of the development process. For this talk, I created this challenge:
- Go from an idea to a running, end-to-end proof-of-concept
- Use AI-assisted tools from conception to delivery
- Use modern technologies that I am NOT familiar with:
  - Full-stack Next.js project
  - IDE with AI capabilities
  - Vector database
- **_Not write a single line of code!!!_**ü§Ø
- Document the process along the way
- Do this in ~1 week

Picky was the use case I settled on. You can [check out the resulting slide deck I presented](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ojmVBc2vzR_AOz46Da5bqfTFf-okOvVnIIPGR74M_rg/edit?usp=sharing).

### üß† Technical Concepts Explored
- Using a IDE with integrated AI capabilities ([Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/)) to üíØ% create, refactor, and troubleshoot code
- Using a LLM (Claude 3.5 Sonnet) to generate various artifacts through the project, e.g. project plans, architectural design, code, documentation
- Using a LLM (GPT-4o) + accompanying [prompt engineering](src/config/llmconfig.js) for the computer vision tasks needed to analyze images
- Using a LLM (OpenAI) for generating embeddings for semantic search
- Using a vector database (pgvector in Supabase) for storing and querying embeddings

### üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
- Next.js full-stack app with Tailwind CSS
- Supabase with pgvector

### üîë Key Features of Picky
The full scope is shown below, but time constraints limited what I was able to implement.

1. **User Authentication**: Users can sign up, log in, and reset their passwords. Each user has their own private gallery.

2. **Image Upload**: Users can select and add images to their personal gallery.

3. **Image Analysis**: Each uploaded image is analyzed for:
   - Objects (including text, inanimate objects, people, landmarks)
   - Scene detection
   - Qualitative aspects (description of what the image is showing)

4. ~**Manual Metadata**: Users can manually add additional metadata, such as:~
   - ~Geolocation where the photo was taken~
   - ~Names of people appearing in the photo~

5. **Data Persistence**: All image data is stored in an optimal database for natural language searching (e.g., vector database for RAG-style querying).

6. ~**Facial Recognition**: The system can perform facial recognition to:~
   - ~Match faces with known people in the datastore~
   - ~Automatically tag people in new photos~

7. **Gallery View**: A user interface allows browsing through all images in a masonry-style layout within the user's private gallery.

8. **Semantic Search**: Users can ~speak or~ type requests, and the system will:
   - Execute a semantic search
   - Identify images matching the query
   - Display a filtered list in a masonry-style layout

9. ~**User Account Management**: Users can manage their account settings, update profile information, and control privacy settings.~

### üèÅ Launching the app
To start the app's backend server, run this command from the /Picky-Next folder:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

### üñ±Ô∏è Using the app
Upon launching the app, you will be redirected to the login page. Use the 'sign-in account' you created in the setup steps above to log in.

Once logged in, you'll see the image gallery. By default it will be empty, so you'll need to upload some images. Click on the '+' button in the nav and the upload area will appear.  You can use it to upload 1 or more images at once.

After uploading images, the gallery will refresh to display the newly uploaded images.  You can click any image to see a larger version, along with the current metadata.  **Important:** Only basic info about the image (name, date uploaded, file type) will appear at this point.

To perform the full computer vision analysis, you have to manually trigger it. Click on the purple ü™Ñ button to initiate the analysis of _all unprocessed images_. This analysis will take 2-10 seconds for each 1 image, so be patient. There is no indicator that the analysis is complete üò≥ (I just didn't implement it -- sorry).  You can go check the 'images' table in Supabase to see the status for each image change '_unprocessed_' -> '_pending_' -> '_complete_'.

To check the result of the computer vision analysis, click on an image to see a larger version. The metadata will be updated with the results of the computer vision analysis.

Now you can conduct a semantic search. Enter a search query in the text box and click 'Search' to see a filtered list of images that match the search query.  Click the 'X' to reset the search.
