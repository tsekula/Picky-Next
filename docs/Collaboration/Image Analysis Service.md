The Image Analysis Service should be handled asynchronously from the image upload. The image upload and refresh on the client app should happen independent of the running of the image analysis. can you describe at a high level how our app would be updated to accommodate the image analysis service?

# Image Analysis Service

## High-Level Overview

To accommodate the Image Analysis Service as an asynchronous process separate from the image upload, we'll need to make several changes to our application architecture. Here's a high-level overview of how we can update our app:

1. **Image Upload Process**:
   - Keep the current image upload process, but add a step to queue the uploaded image for analysis.
   - After successful upload, add the image to an analysis queue instead of immediately triggering analysis.

2. **Analysis Queue**:
   - Implement a queue system (e.g., using a database table or a message queue service) to store pending analysis tasks.
   - Each queue item should contain the image ID and any necessary metadata.

3. **Background Worker**:
   - Create a background worker process that runs independently of the web application.
   - This worker will continuously check the analysis queue for new tasks.
   - When a task is found, the worker will perform the image analysis and update the database with the results.

4. **Database Updates**:
   - Add a new column to the `images` table to track the analysis status (e.g., 'pending', 'in_progress', 'completed', 'failed').
   - Update the `analysis_results` table to include a timestamp for when the analysis was completed.

5. **API Updates**:
   - Modify the image upload API to add the newly uploaded image to the analysis queue.
   - Create a new API endpoint to check the analysis status of an image.

6. **Frontend Updates**:
   - Update the gallery view to show the analysis status for each image.
   - Implement a way to refresh or poll for updated analysis results.

This approach allows the image upload and refresh on the client app to happen independently of the image analysis process, improving the user experience and system scalability.
