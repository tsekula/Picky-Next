# Image Analysis Workflow

1. **Image Upload Trigger**
   - When an image is successfully uploaded via the Image Upload Service, trigger the analysis process.

2. **Preprocessing**
   - Retrieve the image from the Data Storage Service.
   - Validate the image format and size.
   - Resize or compress the image if necessary for optimal processing.

3. **Object Detection**
   - Use a pre-trained model (e.g., YOLO, Faster R-CNN) to identify objects in the image.
   - Generate bounding boxes and confidence scores for detected objects.

4. **Scene Detection**
   - Employ a scene classification model to categorize the overall context of the image.
   - Determine indoor/outdoor setting, event type, or location type.

5. **Text Recognition (OCR)**
   - Apply Optical Character Recognition to extract any text present in the image.
   - Process and clean the extracted text.

6. **Facial Detection and Recognition**
   - Detect faces in the image using a face detection algorithm.
   - For each detected face, generate facial encodings.
   - Compare encodings with known faces in the user's gallery for potential matches.

7. **Image Description Generation**
   - Use a captioning model or multi-modal AI to generate a textual description of the image content.

8. **Metadata Extraction**
   - Extract any available EXIF data from the image file (e.g., date taken, camera model, geolocation).

9. **Vector Embedding Generation**
   - Generate a vector embedding of the image for similarity search purposes.

10. **Analysis Results Aggregation**
    - Compile all analysis results into a structured format.

11. **Database Update**
    - Store the analysis results in the Data Storage Service.
    - Update the `Image` table with new metadata and the vector embedding.
    - Create entries in the `ImageTag` table for detected objects, scenes, and recognized faces.
    - Store the full analysis results in the `AnalysisResult` table.

12. **Post-processing**
    - Update the image's `last_analyzed` timestamp.
    - Trigger any necessary cache invalidations or updates.

13. **Notification**
    - Optionally, notify the user that their image has been analyzed and is ready for viewing/searching.

14. **Error Handling**
    - Implement robust error handling throughout the process.
    - Log any issues for debugging and monitoring purposes.

15. **Performance Monitoring**
    - Track processing time and resource usage for optimization purposes.
